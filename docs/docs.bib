abstract = {Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data A sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of 1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.}

abstract = {Genotypeâ€“phenotype relationships are notoriously complicated. Idiosyncratic interactions between specific combinations of mutations occur and are difficult to predict. Yet it is increasingly clear that many interactions can be understood in terms of global epistasis. That is, mutations may act additively on some underlying, unobserved trait, and this trait is then transformed via a nonlinear function to the observed phenotype as a result of subsequent biophysical and cellular processes. Here we infer the shape of such global epistasis in three proteins, based on published high-throughput mutagenesis data. To do so, we develop a maximum-likelihood inference procedure using a flexible family of monotonic nonlinear functions spanned by an I-spline basis. Our analysis uncovers dramatic nonlinearities in all three proteins; in some proteins a model with global epistasis accounts for virtually all of the measured variation, whereas in others we find substantial local epistasis as well. This method allows us to test hypotheses about the form of global epistasis and to distinguish variance components attributable to global epistasis, local epistasis, and measurement error.}
