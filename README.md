`multidms` is a Python package written by the 
[Matsen group](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/)
in collaboration with 
[William DeWitt](https://wsdewitt.github.io/)
and the
[Bloom Lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html).
It can be used to fit a single global-epistasis model to one or more deep mutational scanning experiments, 
with the goal of estimating the effects of individual mutations, 
and how much the effects differ between experiments.
