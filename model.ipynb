    "## Overview of model\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multidms` model applies to a case where you have DMS datasets for two or more homologs and are interested in identifying shifts in mutational effects between homologs.\n",
    "To do so, the model defines one homolog as a reference homolog.\n",
    "For each mutation, the model fits one parameter that quantifies the effect of the mutation in the reference homolog.\n",
    "For each non-reference homolog, it also fits a shift parameter that quantifies the shift in the mutation's effect in the non-reference homolog relative to the reference.\n",
    "Shift parameters can be regularized, encouraging most of them to be close to zero.\n",
    "This regularization step is a useful way to eliminate the effects of experimental noise, and is most useful in cases where you expect most mutations to have the same effects between homologs, such as for homologs that are close relatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses a global-epistasis function to disentangle the effects of multiple mutations on the same variant.\n",
    "To do so, it assumes that mutational effects additively influence a latent biophysical property the protein (e.g., $\\Delta G$ of folding).\n",
    "The mutational-effect parameters described above operate at this latent level.\n",
    "The global-epistasis function then assumes a sigmoidal relationship between a protein's latent property and its functional score measured in the experiment (e.g., log enrichment score).\n",
    "Ultimately, mutaitonal parameters, as well as ones controlling the shape of the sigmoid, are all jointly fit to maximize agreement between predicted and observed functional scores acorss all variants of all homologs."

    "## Detailed description of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "For each variant $v$ from homolog $h$, we use a global-epistasis function $g$ to convert a latent phenotype $\\phi$ to a functional score $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(v,h) = g_{\\alpha}(\\phi(v,h))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is a sigmoid and $\\alpha$ is a set of parameters encoding the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latent phenotype is computed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(v,h) = c_h + \\sum_{m \\in v} (x_m + s_{m,h})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $c_h$ is the wildtype latent phenotype for homolog $h$\n",
    "* $x_m$ is the latent phenotypic effect of mutation $m$. See details below.\n",
    "* $s_{m,h}$ is the shift of the effect of mutation $m$ in homolog $h$. These parameters are fixed to zero for the reference homolog. For non-reference homologs, they are defined in the same way as $x_m$ parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x_m$ variable is defined such that mutations are always relative to the reference homolog.\n",
    "This way, each homolog informs the exact same parameters, even at sites that differ in wildtype amino acid.\n",
    "For instance, if the wildtype amino acid at site 30 is an A in the reference homolog, but is a Y in a second homolog, then a Y30G mutation in the second homolog is defined as the sum of the following two mutations relative to A: A30Y (negated) and A30G.\n",
    "This approach assumes that mutational effects can be negated, such that A30Y has the opposite effect as Y30A.\n",
    "It also assumes that mutational effects are additive, such that the effect of Y30G is the sum of the effects of Y30A and A30G.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below expression defines this approach more explicitly for an arbitrary site. It uses the notation $x_{\\mathtt{X},n,\\mathtt{Z}}$ where $\\mathtt{X}$ and $\\mathtt{Z}$ are amino acids.\n",
    "For a site $n$, if $aa_{\\text{wt}}$ is the site's wildtype amino acid in a non-reference homolog, $aa_{\\text{mut}}$ is a mutant amino acid in a variant of that homolog, and $aa_{\\text{ref}}$ is the site's wildtype amino acid in the reference homolog, then $x_m$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{aa_{\\text{wt}},n,aa_{\\text{mut}}} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      x_{aa_{\\text{ref}},n,aa_{\\text{mut}}} & \\text{if } aa_{\\text{wt}} = aa_{\\text{ref}}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can express the whole model with reference only to coefficients that differ from the reference homolog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we fit parameters using a loss function with one term that scores differences between predicted and observed values and another that uses L1 regularization to penalize non-zero $s_{m,h}$ values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{h} \\left[\\sum_{v} L_{\\text{fit}}(y_{v,h}, f(v,h)) + \\lambda \\sum_{m} |s_{m,h}|\\right]$$\n",
